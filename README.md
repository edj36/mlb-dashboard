# MLB Dashboard

Three different implementations that aggregate MLB game data and display it.

A REPL like functionality will be implemented to parse queries and return results from common baseball databases, like Retrosheet. (This is a work in progress)

# Usage
You can either run in a browser (locally or at [edj36.github.io/mlb-dashboard](https://edj36.github.io/mlb-dashboard)) or with `ocaml` or with `python`
